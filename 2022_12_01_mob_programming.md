# A familiar picture of a software team

# A typical day
Teams does sprint planning, everyone gets "their" Stories, Bugs, Tasks.
The sprint starts and everyone gets back to their corner, they can finally
work on their committed piece of the spring ALONE.

Here is a bright young man Taavi, who has just made a bugfix. Our team is
very progressive and doesn't trust its own members - every commit to the mainline
goes through a code review.

Taavi tags me and other team members for the review.
I know that reviews are better done sooner than later, so I pull myself out
of my current context and start reviewing the code.
First, I try to understand what exactly caused the bug and how the changes
fix it. The bug is non-trivial and is related to a domain area not know to me.
I spend half an hour just to get deeper into the problem.
Finally I understand how the code caused the bug and how Taavi's code fixes it.
But I don't quite agree with implementation and leave some comments and questions.

Taavi has already started working on another issue. So when my comments arrive,
his mind is already in another context, he has to "switch" it back, recall
everything previously done, answer me and even update the code according to the
comments. Then the cycle repeats.

Some teams won't agree with this narrative. Some teams have a rule that when
a review comes, everyone drops whatever they are doing and review the code
together. That's somewhat a step forward, until it's not. Everyone has to
be pulled of their current contexts. Everyone comments on a ready work and
then gets back to their silos, waiting for the author to fix them.
And what if the changes are BIG? What if there are some hundreds lines of code
and some reviewers don't agree with any of it? Shall everything be re-written?
Does this sound familiar?

I believe you see how flawed this whole thing is. It consists of ridiculous
amounts of delayed communication and feedback, in other words - the feedback loops
are horribly long and the feedback is never there when you need it most.
When do we need that feedback? We need it *before*, *during* and *right after*
we put our thoughts in code.

What if your team mate is always there to provide that feedback?
Together you study the issue *before* - so you get the understanding faster
and catch more subtle details. Together you discuss and prototype the implementation
*before*, so that you both agree on the general approach.
You continue discussing *during* the implementation, and every line of code gets
its immediate feedback. You once again review the changeset before committing
and finally you push it  - to the **mainline**, since you formally had an
"extra pair of eyes" watching every step.

That's Ð° fellow developer on your shoulder. How about getting more people involved?
It's not just "an extra pair of eyes" then - it's a hive mind backing you up.

What is a hive mind? It's
the minds of the seasoned programmers amplifying one-another,
the minds of the juniors, who have a great opportunity to learn fast and deep,
the minds of the recently joined members, who can immediately contribute and be guided while contributing,
the minds of QA, who can nurture the quality while the code is being cast,
the mind of PO, ready to provide business insight,
the minds of designers, database engineers, infrastructure specialists and so on
- the minds and the experience that you need here and now.

At this point, it's not just you, but the whole *mob* of people working
on your JIRA ticket. So, why even assign the tickets to individuals in the first place,
when you can collaborate on every issue and solve them together?
Why spread the effort, doing something in parallel, when the team
can focus on one important thing at a time?


We call this focused collaborative software development sessions
- "Mob programming" or simply "mobbing".
I've been doing mob programming for almost four years now. For me, mobbing is
light years ahead of work done in silos.


## Collaboration

There are many ways to have a mobbing session, but they have some common rules.
First, there are roles: there are **navigators** and one **driver**.
The **navigators** guide the driver, who is writing the code.

There is a catch though. People would soon get bored watching the driver and
the driver gets tired too.
So it's essential that you switch the **driver** seat often.
How often? If a mob of three changes the **driver** seat once in ten minutes,
it means that every one would get to the keyboard only once in half an hour!

Ideal loop: write, verify, commit and change driver

Sometimes the navigators have to literally tell the driver what to write -
word after word, symbol after symbol - e.g. if a driver is not familiar
with the project, the framework, or even the programming language.


### Spaces

On a typical mobbing day, team members gather closer in dedicated space -
real or virtual and


## Mobbing

"A mob" is usually something wild and uncontrollable. Nevertheless, mobbing
has some necessary key elements which make it effective.


Let's call this group of people a *Mob*.
A *mob* - is not necessarily the whole team, People join and leave when
needed, but in the end the work is done by a *mob* of professionals.
